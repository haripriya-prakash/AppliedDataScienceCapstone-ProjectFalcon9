# AppliedDataScienceCapstone-ProjectFalcon9

Project Summary

•	Goal: Predict Falcon 9 first stage landing success to estimate launch costs using public data and machine learning.

•	Key Questions: How do payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbit affect landing success? Are landings improving over time? What is the best ML algorithm for this prediction?

•	Method:

a) Data: Collected via SpaceX API and Wikipedia web scraping

b) Prep: Data cleaned, missing values handled, one-hot encoding for classification

c) Analysis: EDA with visualizations and SQL; visual analytics with Folium/Plotly Dash

d) Modeling: Built and tuned classification models; Decision Tree gave best results
